## Protein Extraction {.page_break_before}

First, proteins must be isolated from the sample matrix. Because some proteins alter other proteins, the goal is to simultaneously solubilize and denature proteins. This can be achieved with a combination of detergent and chaotropic agent. 

1. Choice of Lysis buffer
* detergents (i.e. SDS) assist solubilization of hydrophobic proteins
* Urea can cause chemical modifications [@DOI:10.1016/j.ab.2013.10.024]

2. Sample type and homogenisation methods
* commonly used: sonication or bead beating
* specialised sample preparation protocols for non-denaturing protein isolation (i.e. for LiP-MS, HDMX-MS etc)

3. chemicals to avoid or remove prior to MS analysis: PEGs, detergents etc
* A common contamination is human keratin. Hence, gloves are mandatory during sample preparation.

4. removal of contaminations, Protein Precipitation
* detergent reomoval resins, S-TRAP (Protifi) etc

5. protein alkylation
* choices of reduction and alkylation reagents, TCEP/DTT/2BME, Chloroacetamide/iodoacetamide, n-ethyl maleimide, MMTS [@DOI:10.1074/mcp.M116.064048]
* It is important to select the correct cysteine modification during the database search. For example, the use of iodacetamide introduces a mass shift of 57.021 Da while MMTS leads to a mass shift of 45.988 Da.
